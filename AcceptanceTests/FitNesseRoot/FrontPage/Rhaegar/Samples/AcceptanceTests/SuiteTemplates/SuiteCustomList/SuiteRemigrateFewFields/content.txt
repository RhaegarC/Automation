As an administrator
I can update !-SharePoint-! existing item in the second migration
So that I can view the updated value of the existing item in !-SharePoint-!

!1 scenarios
![
Given a migration was run with duplicate found option "Update existing item (mapped fields)"
When I only add the mappings in Map Data tab for the existing fields which need to be updated
And I run a migration with duplicate found option "Update existing item (mapped fields)" again
Then I can only view the updated value for existing fields which was adding mappings before migration in SharePoint
And the value of existing fields which was not added in mappings would be retained.

When I only add the mappings in Map Data tab for the new fields
And I run a migration with option "Add or upgrade List Fields" enabled
And with duplicate found option "Update existing item (mapped fields)" selected
Then I can view the new fields are added for all item in SharePoint
And only the new fields of item selected in source has value
