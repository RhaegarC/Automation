As an administrator
I can migrate proper navigation links to quickr
so that the customers can access the pages from navigator.

Given I created a quick place
And I add extra folder into it
And I add empty folder into it
And I enabled provisioning navigation links for the database

Then I can find notes links in navigation links

Then I can see all the links are finalized properly, including the ones for folders
