!1 scenarios
![
Given Quickr pages(Standard page/Wiki page/Blog page) were selected as source data
And "Quickr Pages" was selected as Sourct Data Definition
And Word/Pdf was selected as Target Data Definition
And mapping "{Attachments} -> Doc.Attachments" or "{Attachemnts} -> Files" was added in Map Data tab
When I run a migration with Web Service or Import Service or O365
Then I can view selected Quickr pages are migrated as Word/Pdf in SharePoint

Given links of migrated pages were added in Quickr pages before migration
When I run a link finalization after the migration
Then I can open the migrated Word/Pdf by finalized link in migrated Word/Pdf
