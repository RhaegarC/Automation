As an administrator
I can migrate pages with multiple versions in Quickr to !-SharePoint-!
So that I can view version history of these migrated pages in !-SharePoint-!

!1 scenarios
![
Given pages in Quickr have multiple versions created before
And "All versions" was selected in "Document Selection" tab of Source Data Definition
And "When creating List, enable versioning" on the SharePoint tab was enabled
And "Create new version (if modified)" in "If duplicate found:" was selected
And Default Custom List template was selected as target data definition
And "Preserve Created/Modified dates" was enabled
When I run a migration
Then I can view version history of these migrated pages in SharePoint
