Given large size images (such as 2MB) were added in Notes document
And "Display images after loading" was enabled in DB properties
And Word/Pdf/(Pdf/A) was selected as Target
And make sure mapping "BodyImages -> Files" or "BodyImages -> Attachments" wasn't added
When I run a migration
Then I can view "[Delay Load image cannot be extracted]" displayed in migrated Word/Pdf/(Pdf/A) instead of images
And warning messages "An image was not extracted correctly.  This may indicate a corrupted Notes document or an image that was saved in a way that we could not extract.  Please try unchecking the "Display images after loading" database property, editing and resaving the document." shown in Log
