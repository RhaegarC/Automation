 As an administrator
 I can migrate data to PDF/PDFA
 So that I can view them in !-SharePoint-! without task suspended which caused by !-ModDate-! value empty error

!1 scenarios
![
Given PDF/PDFA Documents were selected in Target Data Definition
And {DocModified}->Doc.Modified was added in Map Data Tab
When I run a migration
Then I can view them in SharePoint without task suspended which caused by ModDate value empty error

When I deleteÂ {DocModified}->Doc.Modified in Map Data Tab
And I run a migration
Then I can view the friendly error message instead of ModDate value empty error
