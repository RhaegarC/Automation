As an administrator
I can migrate documents to read-only html files
So that I can have different types of target files

Given I set read-only to true of the File field in mapping tab
When I run migration
Then the controls in the target html files are disabled

When I run migration
Then the controls in the target html files are NOT disabled

Given the source field is render with the type html
And the target field type is File

Then I can see the read-only field in mapping tab

And the target field type is File
