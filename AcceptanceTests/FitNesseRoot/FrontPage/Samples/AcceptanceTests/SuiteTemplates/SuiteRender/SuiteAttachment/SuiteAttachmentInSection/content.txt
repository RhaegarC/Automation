!1 user story
As an administrator
I can render attachments in sections into word
So that I can view them migrated properly

!1 scenarios
![
Given attachments were added in sections in Notes document
And Render was selected as Source Data Definition
And "BodyHtml""BodyImages" were added in Source Data Fields
And mappings "RenderImages -> Doc.Images""BodyImages -> Doc.Images""RenderAttachments -> Doc.Attachments""RenderEmbeddedObjects -> Doc.Attachment" were added

When I run a migration
Then I can see attachments in sections are migrated properly
And attachments icon are correct
And I can not see warning "Failed to replace Attachment icon:..."
