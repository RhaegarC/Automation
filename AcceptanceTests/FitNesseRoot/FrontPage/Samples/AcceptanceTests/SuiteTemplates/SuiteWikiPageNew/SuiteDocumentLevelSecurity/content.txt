As an administrator
I can migrate source items with permissions to Office365 with Azure Turbo Mode 
So that I can view those permissions of migrated items in Office365

!1 scenarios:
![
Given Windows Identity Foundation 3.5 was installed
And the type of SharePoint Environments was set to "SharePoint web services (Office 365 Authentication)"
And the Azure Turbo Mode was enabled
And source data with permissions was selected in Designer
And "Map Reader/Author fields" of Advanced tab was checked
And the user mappings were added into UserMapping.xml
And the xml file path was set in User Mapping tab of Options
When I run a migration
Then I can view those permissions of migrated items in Office365
