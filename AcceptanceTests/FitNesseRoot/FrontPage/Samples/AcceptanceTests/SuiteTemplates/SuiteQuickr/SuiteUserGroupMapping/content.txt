As an administrator
I can migrate quickr group to sharepoint
so that I can grant proper right for users in sharepoint

!3 scenarios:
![
Given I set source versions to "all versions"
And I choose to map groups
When I run the migration to SharePoint
Then I can see the group is migrated successfully

Given I set source versions to "current versions"
And I choose to map groups
When I run the migration to SharePoint
Then I can see the group is migrated successfully
