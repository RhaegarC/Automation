As an administrator
I can create a source data field which column type is 'ViewColumn'
And mapping 'ViewColumn' to a target data field
So that I can migrate a multi value column in 'ViewColumn' to sql server

Given a source data field was added
And its column type is 'ViewColumn'
And it was mapping to a target data field
When I run migration
Then I can view all the values were migrated to sql server
And they were separated in different rows just as they were set in Notes
