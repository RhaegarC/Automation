As an administrator
I can create tables or add table fields to SQL target DB automatically
So that I can view these created tables or added table fields in SQL target DB

!1 scenarios
![
Given "Primary Table" and "Normalized Tables" names were set in "List Definition" tab of "Target Data Definition"
And "Create Tables" checkbox was enabled
And fields were added in "Data Fields" tab of "Target Data Definition" (including normalized tables)
And "Primary key" were set (including normalized tables)
And mappings were added in "Map Data" tab
When I click "Run Provisioning Only"
Then I can view tables were created in SQL target DB
And the fields of these tables were created based on the fields added in "Target Data Definition"
When I click "Run Job"
Then I can view the data were migrated to these tables
