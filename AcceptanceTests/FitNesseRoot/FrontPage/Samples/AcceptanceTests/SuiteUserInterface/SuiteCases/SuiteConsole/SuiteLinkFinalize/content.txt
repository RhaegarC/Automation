As an administrator
I can set execution time-out in Link Tracking tab in Options
So that if I have larger data in the Link Tracking DB, I do not have to worry about task failing due to a short timeout
 
!1 scenarios
![
Given MNSP was installed
When I open Options - Link Tracking tab
Then I can see the default execution time-out is 30
When I type exists words in the Old URL Prefix in Console - Tools - Link Analyzer/Updater/Finalizer - Update Links
And I click Preview button
Then I can view the task complete

When I clear the execution time-out
And I click save button
And I reopen Options
Then I can view the execution time-out change to default 30
